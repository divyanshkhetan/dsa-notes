It is very difficult to make you understand trees using just text or some images so here is a great youtube video for basic introduction to trees - [Here](https://youtu.be/qH6yxkw0u78). 

In the video, **humblefool** (*you might want to read about him and the story of mycodeschool*) describes a tree with each node having just two children. This is called a **binary tree**. But this is not a rule. In a general tree any node can have as many children as it wants. An example would look like this:

We will be covering both the types of trees and I'll add any algorithm that I study here. I am sorry for this not being all original but just a compilation of resources.

We'll be covering all the topics like this. Introduction will be given by a youtube video and I'll give you the code so that you can code and compare or COPY-PASTE :P.

I am providing you everything at one place.
