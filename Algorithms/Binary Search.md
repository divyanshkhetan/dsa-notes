### Binary Search Algorithm

Time Complexity: O(log n)

- This algorithms is used for searching.
- It's prerequisite is that the array to be searched must be sorted.

Here is a great explanation for the same: [MyCodeSchool YT Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uXyPJ0Pew).

Problem: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search).
Make sure that you checkout the [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/solution/) for the above problem.

**Points to remember:**
- low = 0 and high = n-1
- low <= high
- array must be sorted
